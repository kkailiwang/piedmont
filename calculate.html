        <p class='para'> <span class="parabold">State of Black Education Oakland </span><br>State of Black Education’s mission is to create equitable space to reflect on Oakland’s Black community’s experiences with education in order to create and advocate for informed policy demands. Current efforts include pushing for more Black educators in Oakland schools, raising awareness of the fact that most Black graduates in OUSD do not meet A-G requirements for 4-year universities, and urging the district to use excess property to help house teachers who cannot afford to live in Oakland. Past campaigns include the Opportunity Ticket, through which the organization helped pass a policy that gives priority to parents to select the school of their choice if their school happens to close down.
