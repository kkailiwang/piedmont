        Fund</a></span><br>The A to Z Fund provides Oakland Public Schools teachers with extra training
    and distributes money to educators to use for field trips, music, sports, and other underfunded opportunities from A
    to Z. Now, with distanced learning, the A to Z is funding supplies to help kids continue to learn at home (science
    kits, books, etc.) or through their computers, PPE for teachers, and school supplies. The organization also
    distributes more money to schools with the most students who are low-income, English language learners, or in foster
    care. Since 2017 The A to Z Fund has awarded almost $450,000 in A to Z Fund grants to more than 300 Oakland public
    school educators.

        REACH</a></span><br>The Oakland REACH is a grassroots, parent-led organization committed to empowering black and
    brown families from underserved public schools. Through mobilized outreach, school enrollment support, family
    advocacy fellowships and interpersonal connections, The Oakland REACH hopes to equip the next generation of OUSD
    students with a higher quality education. In light of COVID and the national health crisis, The Oakland Reach is
    planning to launch it’s biggest, boldest initiative yet: a city-wide “Virtual Hub,” where students can access online
    educational tools from a central website.

    The city wide virtual hub is a Google Classroom platform to provide families of early elementary students with
    supports for immediate needs to survive this period. The pilot phase of the Hub consisted of a 5-week summer program
    with 180 students, taught by 14 teachers. If this Hub existed in the physical world, it would be that “one-stop
    place and space” that provides both academic and other wrap-around resource support that is for and about uplifting
    the whole family.

        Education Oakland </a></span><br>State of Black Education’s mission is to create equitable space to reflect on
    Oakland’s Black community’s experiences with education in order to create and advocate for informed policy demands.
    Current efforts include pushing for more Black educators in Oakland schools, raising awareness of the fact that most
    Black graduates in OUSD do not meet A-G requirements for 4-year universities, and urging the district to use excess
    property to help house teachers who cannot afford to live in Oakland. Past campaigns include the Opportunity Ticket,
    through which the organization helped pass a policy that gives priority to parents to select the school of their
    choice if their school happens to close down.

        Justice</a></span><br>The Planting Justice Education Program activates people most directly impacted by poverty
    and food injustice to create a more local and sustainable food system by developing their skills in ecological

        Project</a></span><br>Black Organizing Project is a Black member-led community organization reviving the spirit
    of Oakland’s Black community through relationship building, leadership development, political education and
    policy-change. Through their Bettering Our Schools System (B.O.S.S) Campaign started in 2011, the vision is to end
    the criminalization of Black and Brown students in the Oakland Unified School District; Invest in alternative models
    of school safety that don’t rely on police; And to restructure the current policies and practices within OUSD that
    don’t take a restorative justice approach to student discipline and promotes the school to prison pipeline. They are
    calling for the immediate removal of the Oakland Unified School police department. On June 24, 2020, OUSD will be
    voting on thier George Floyd Resolution to eliminate OSPD. If the board votes in favor of the resolution, Oakland
    will be the first district in the nation to eliminate an entire armed school police department.
