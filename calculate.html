        <p class='para'> <span class="parabold">State of Black Education Oakland </span><br>State of Black Education’s mission is to create equitable space to reflect on Oakland’s Black community’s experiences with education in order to create and advocate for informed policy demands. Current efforts include pushing for more Black educators in Oakland schools, raising awareness of the fact that most Black graduates in OUSD do not meet A-G requirements for 4-year universities, and urging the district to use excess property to help house teachers who cannot afford to live in Oakland. Past campaigns include the Opportunity Ticket, through which the organization helped pass a policy that gives priority to parents to select the school of their choice if their school happens to close down.

            <span class="parabold">Black Organizing Project</span><br>Black Organizing Project is a Black member-led community organization reviving the spirit of Oakland’s Black community through relationship building, leadership development, political education and policy-change. Through their Bettering Our Schools System (B.O.S.S) Campaign started in 2011, the vision is to end the criminalization of Black and Brown students in the Oakland Unified School District; Invest in alternative models of school safety that don’t rely on police; And to restructure the current policies and practices within OUSD that don’t take a restorative justice approach to student discipline and promotes the school to prison pipeline. They are calling for the immediate removal of the Oakland Unified School police department. On June 24, 2020, OUSD will be voting on thier George Floyd Resolution to eliminate OSPD. If the board votes in favor of the resolution, Oakland will be the first district in the nation to eliminate an entire armed school police department.
