<p class="para"><span class="parabold">#popthebubble</span><br>
  It is common to hear remarks on how us Piedmonters live in “such a bubble”, referencing the tight-knit and highly involved nature of this small community.
<br><br>
But the bubble that exists around Piedmont is not just metaphorical.
There is a <a class="linky" href="https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2018/04/17/to-segregate-or-not-to-segregate-that-is-the-bay-areas-question/">concrete difference</a> between the racial and economic makeup
of those inside the “bubble” and those in the community directly surrounding it.
But these differences have ramifications beyond a lack of diversity.
It’s important to acknowledge the <a class="linky" href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf">concrete, systemic inequalities</a> that
  exist in our own community of Oakland.
<br><br>
Inspired to take long-term action to solve issues that deeply affect our community,
we've created POPS, a website that serves as a long-term hub for Piedmont to
centralize our donations to three Oakland based organizations that work to empower
black youth and the Oakland School systems.
<br><br>
We envision this hub as a place where Piedmont can come together to show our
Oakland community the same care we show Piedmont.
<br><br>
Here, you can also find <a class="linky" href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11700592/black-parents-say-its-up-to-them-to-fix-unequal-oakland-schools">resources</a> about inequities present in Oakland schools
to raise awareness about what our own community can do to bring justice to
Oakland Public Schools.
<br><br>
We also hope to use this platform to share resources and student voices that
discuss racism within Piedmont, as we want to acknowledge there is work to be
done within our community, too. We hope that our donations and awareness
can help breakdown the historic <a class="linky" href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-photos-americas-separate-and-unequal-schools/">systematic educational divide</a> between Oakland
and Piedmont.
<br><br>
The organizations we are supporting are the <a class="linky" href="http://blackorganizingproject.org/">Black Organizing Project</a>,
<a class="linky" href="https://plantingjustice.org/">Planting Justice</a>, and <a class="linky" href="https://www.stateofblackeducation.com/about-us">The State of Black Education Oakland</a>. They are all focused on
improving the state of Oakland Public education through a nutritional focus,
educator support programs, and policy for combatting the school to prison pipeline.
<br><br>
Activism has long been regarded as more of a moment than a movement. With this
initiative, we hope to start Piedmont’s journey toward long-lasting change.
