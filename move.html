<p class="para">We’ve been amazed to see the outpouring of donations from youth to support organizations in the Black Lives Matter movement—but this movement cannot be supported by youth alone.
<br><br>
Inspired to take long-term action to solve issues that deeply affect our community, we’ve created POPS, a website that serves as a long-term hub for Piedmont to centralize our donations to three Oakland based organizations that work to empower black youth and the Oakland School systems. We envision this hub as a place where the Piedmont community can come together to show our Oakland community the same care we show Piedmont.
<br><br>
Our website also displays facts about the inequities present in Oakland schools to raise awareness about what our own community can do to bring justice to Oakland Public Schools. We hope that our donations and awareness can help breakdown the historic systematic educational divide between Oakland and Piedmont.
<br><br>
The organizations we are supporting are the Black Organizing Project, Planting Justice, and The State of Black Education Oakland. They are all focused on improving the state of Oakland Public education through a nutritional focus, educator support programs, and policy for combatting the school to prison pipeline.
<br><br>
Activism has long been regarded as more of a moment than a movement. With this initiative, we hope to start the journey toward long lasting change.
