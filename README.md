to deploy, go to this link:
https://app.netlify.com/sites/zen-shockley-d38a03/deploys
log in
you'll see a list of all the git pushes we've done. the top is the most recent
then click on the top one (or whatever one you want to deploy)
and then click "preview deploy" to make sure everything looks good
and then if it looks good, then "publish deploy"
and BAM. THE PEOPLE WILL ROAR WITH GRATITUDE AND APPROVAL
and let the donations roll in

the end
of the super sexy recipe of deploying from git to netlify ;)
